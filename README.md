# wordpress_portfolio
I developed this portfolio website using WordPress as the content management system. This allows the user to easily update and add new content to the site. I built the theme using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then integrated it with WordPress using a plug-in called "pods." This plug-in allows for the creation, management, and deployment of customized content types and fields. To display dynamic content added through WordPress, I utilized PHP in the code. The theme features a custom design, including the use of CSS3 properties such as flex-box and the grid layout. The website is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices.
